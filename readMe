# 📘 Task Management API (For Learning)

This project is a simple **Task Management REST API** built using:

* Node.js
* Express.js
* MongoDB
* Mongoose

The purpose of this project is to understand:

* How backend servers work
* How APIs are created
* How Express routing works
* How MongoDB connects with Node.js
* How MVC structure is organized

---

# 🎯 What This Project Does

This API allows you to:

* Create a task
* Get all tasks
* Get a single task
* Update a task
* Delete a task

All data is stored inside **MongoDB database**.

---

# 🧠 How the Project Works (Step-by-Step Flow)

When you send a request (for example: `GET /api/tasks`), this is what happens:

```
Client (Postman / Browser)
        ↓
Routes
        ↓
Controller
        ↓
Model
        ↓
MongoDB
        ↓
Response back to Client
```

Now let's understand each part clearly.

├── controllers/
│   └── taskController.js
├── models/
│   └── Task.js
├── routes/

# 📌 1️⃣ server.js (Entry Point)

This is the main file.

It does 5 important things:

1. Imports required packages
2. Connects to MongoDB
3. Adds middleware (like express.json())
4. Registers routes
5. Starts the server

Example idea:

```js
app.use(express.json())
app.use("/api/tasks", taskRoutes)
```

This means:

Any request starting with `/api/tasks` will go to `taskRoutes`.

---

# 📌 2️⃣ config/db.js (Database Connection)

This file connects your application to MongoDB using Mongoose.

It uses:

```js
mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGO_URI)
```

Without this connection, your app cannot store or fetch data.

---

# 📌 3️⃣ models/Task.js (Database Schema)

This file defines the structure of a Task.

Example:

```js
{
  title: String,
  description: String,
  status: String
}
```

Think of this like a blueprint for your data.

Mongoose uses this model to:

* Create documents
* Read documents
* Update documents
* Delete documents

---

# 📌 4️⃣ routes/taskRoutes.js (Routing Layer)

This file defines API endpoints.

Example:

```js
router.get("/", getTasks)
router.post("/", createTask)
```

It connects:

Route → Controller Function

Routes do NOT contain logic.
They just decide where the request should go.

---

# 📌 5️⃣ controllers/taskController.js (Business Logic)

This file contains actual logic.

Example:

```js
const tasks = await Task.find()
res.json(tasks)
```

Controller:

* Talks to Model
* Gets data from MongoDB
* Sends response back to user

This is where most backend logic lives.

---

# 🔁 Example Request Flow (Create Task)

When you send:

```
POST /api/tasks
```

This happens:

1. Request hits server.js
2. Goes to taskRoutes.js
3. Route calls createTask controller
4. Controller uses Task model
5. Model saves data to MongoDB
6. Response is sent back

# 🛠 How to Run This Project

### 1️⃣ Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

### 2️⃣ Create .env file

```
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/taskDB
```

### 3️⃣ Start MongoDB

Make sure MongoDB is running.

### 4️⃣ Run the server

```
npm start
```

Server will run on:

```
http://localhost:5000
```

# 📡 API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint       | Description     |
| ------ | -------------- | --------------- |
| POST   | /api/tasks     | Create task     |
| GET    | /api/tasks     | Get all tasks   |
| GET    | /api/tasks/:id | Get single task |
| PUT    | /api/tasks/:id | Update task     |
| DELETE | /api/tasks/:id | Delete task     |
